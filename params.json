{"name":"Oneechan","tagline":"Maximum rice for 4chan X.","body":"OneeChan\r\n====\r\n\r\nOneeChan is a userscript that functions on top of 4chan X and allows you to customize the site with various functions, themes and mascots. Mascots are not obligatory and can be changed or disabled altogether. \r\n\r\nOriginally developed by [seaweedchan](https://github.com/seaweedchan), this fork adds compability with various 4chan X versions and more custom options.\r\n\r\n\r\n##[Click to Install](https://KevinParnell.github.io/OneeChan/builds/OneeChan.user.js)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Install instructions\r\n\r\nInstalling [4chan X](#compatibility-with-4chan-x-forks-and-others) is **required** for Oneechan to work.\r\n\r\n- Firefox: Requires the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon.

Enabling Quick Reply, Persistent QR and Auto Hide QR in 4chan X is recommended for maximum compatibility. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and OneeChan settings and restarting your browser\r\n\r\n- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, OneeChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality\r\n\r\n- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan/issues) page\r\n\r\n- Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan/wiki) for instructions\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Development & Contribution\r\n\r\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan)\r\n- [Reporting Bugs and Contributing](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\n\r\n[![http://i.imgur.com/usLsE72s.png](http://i.imgur.com/usLsE72s.png)](http://i.imgur.com/usLsE72.png) [![http://i.imgur.com/ytX3qgys.png](http://i.imgur.com/ytX3qgys.png)](http://i.imgur.com/ytX3qgy.png) [![http://i.imgur.com/m5iVBo9s.png](http://i.imgur.com/m5iVBo9s.png)](http://i.imgur.com/m5iVBo9.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
