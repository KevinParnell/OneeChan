- Adjust styling for QR so some elements don't end up slightly smaller than minimal size when Force QR is disabled
- Recolored replies now use the theme's reply opacity (Fixes [#5](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan/issues/5)) and will not overwrite the highlight of linked replies.
- X and Oneechan settings will no longer use the theme's reply opacity (Fixes [#6](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan/issues/6)).

Uses the selected theme's 'Header Text' and 'Body Background' colors for the main scrollbar, and 'Text' and 'Input Background' colors for text boxes. For Webkit, it will also force width size and hide scrollbar buttons, so add '!important' to your customCSS code where necessary.
